This is a simple typing speed test application built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy.

## Features

- Random selection of text content from 3 files
- 60-second typing test
- Calculation of Words Per Minute (WPM)
- Comparison with average typing speed
- User-friendly GUI

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.
3. Make sure you have three text files named `content1.txt`, `content2.txt`, and `content3.txt` in the same directory as the script. These files should contain the text content for the typing tests.
4. Run the script using Python


## How to Use
